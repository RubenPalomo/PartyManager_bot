<br />
Manage the resources and life points of the D&amp;D and other role games parties.<br />
It allows you to:
1- Add characters to the party (one per user).
2- View a list of all the characters in the party and their current and total life points.
3- Set the current and the maximum life points with different commands to make it more convenient for each user.
4- Heal or damage characters easily with a system that alerts each user every time his or her life points change. As a detail and thinking of D&D system, you can heal above maximum health to emulate temporary life points, but you cannot damage below 0.
5- Automatically change the current life points of each character to their maximum life, emulating the long rests in the D&D system.
6- Delete a character or all characters in the party.
All this with fun visual messages.
